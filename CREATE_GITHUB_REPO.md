# Creating the GitHub Repository

## ✅ Git is Ready

I've initialized git and made the first commit in your n8n-gamma-node directory.

## 🚀 Create the GitHub Repo (3 Minutes)

### Step 1: Go to GitHub

Open: **https://github.com/new**

### Step 2: Fill in Details

- **Repository name**: `n8n-nodes-gamma` (or whatever you prefer)
- **Description**: "Official Gamma community node for n8n - Create AI-powered presentations and documents"
- **Visibility**: ✅ Public (required for npm packages)
- **DO NOT** initialize with README (we already have one)
- **DO NOT** add .gitignore (we already have one)
- **DO NOT** add license (we already have one)

### Step 3: Click "Create Repository"

GitHub will show you commands. **Ignore those** and use these instead:

### Step 4: Push Your Code

```bash
cd "/Users/max.jackson/claude-skills + documentation extracter/n8n-gamma-node"

# Add the GitHub remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/n8n-nodes-gamma.git

# Push everything
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME`** with your GitHub username!

---

## 🎯 Or Use Gamma Org

If you want it under the Gamma organization:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/gamma-app/n8n-nodes-gamma.git
git push -u origin main
```

(You'll need permission to push to gamma-app org)

---

## ✅ After Pushing

Your CTO can:
1. Go to repo **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
2. Add secret: `NPM_TOKEN` with the npm token
3. **Done!** CI/CD is ready

---

## 🚀 Then to Publish

1. Update version in `package.json`
2. Commit and push
3. Create a GitHub release (tag like `v0.1.0`)
4. **GitHub automatically publishes to npm!**

---

**Ready to create the repo!** Use the steps above.
