## 🏗️ Project Structure

Based on Gamma's OpenAPI spec and using `@devlikeapro/n8n-openapi-node` for generation.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Development)

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (LTS recommended)
- npm or pnpm
- n8n installed globally (`npm install n8n -g`)

### Development Workflow

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Build the node
npm run build

# 3. Link to local n8n
npm link
cd ~/.n8n/custom
npm link n8n-nodes-gamma

# 4. Start n8n
n8n start

# 5. Open browser at http://localhost:5678
# Search for "Gamma" in nodes panel
```

### Watch Mode (Auto-rebuild)

```bash
npm run dev
# Rebuilds automatically on file changes
```

---

## 🔑 Authentication

The node requires a Gamma API key:

1. Log into [gamma.app](https://gamma.app)
2. Go to Settings & Members → API
3. Generate API key
4. Copy key (starts with `sk-gamma-`)
5. In n8n: Create credential → Gamma API
6. Paste API key

## 🎨 Example Workflows

### ⚡ Auto-Polling Workflow (Recommended!)

**Problem**: Gamma generations are async and take 30-90 seconds to complete.  
**Solution**: Use our auto-polling workflow template!

📥 **Import the workflow**: `examples/auto-polling-workflow.json`

This workflow automatically:
- ✅ Creates the generation
- ✅ Waits 30 seconds
- ✅ Checks status
- ✅ Loops until completed
- ✅ Outputs gammaUrl when done

**No more manual clicking!** This gives users a much better experience.

### Basic: Generate Presentation (Manual Polling)

```
Trigger (Manual/Schedule)
    ↓
Gamma: Create Generation
    - inputText: "Introduction to renewable energy"
    - format: presentation
    - textMode: generate
    - numCards: 10
    ↓
Gamma: Get Generation Status 
    (Click Execute repeatedly until status = "completed")
    ↓
Send Email with gammaUrl
```

⚠️ **Note**: Manual polling requires clicking "Execute" every 30 seconds. Use the auto-polling workflow above for better UX!

### Advanced: Content Pipeline

```
RSS Feed (New Article)
    ↓
Extract Content
    ↓
Gamma: Create Generation
    - inputText: {{article content}}
    - format: presentation
    ↓
Wait for Completion (poll)
    ↓
Gamma: Create from Template (social version)
    - gammaId: {{generated gammaId}}
    - format: social
    ↓
Post to Social Media
```
